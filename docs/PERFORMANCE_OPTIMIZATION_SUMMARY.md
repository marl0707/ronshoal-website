# Performance Optimization Summary

## Completed Optimizations

### 1. Critical Resource Preloading
- Added preconnect hints for Google Fonts to establish early connections
- Added preload directive for Google Fonts CSS to prioritize loading
- Added preload for hero background image on homepage

### 2. Font Loading Optimization
- Converted Google Fonts to async loading with fallback for non-JS browsers
- Added font loading optimization script to prevent FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text)
- Implemented font loading promises to detect when fonts are ready

### 3. Image Lazy Loading
- Added `loading="lazy"` attribute to all images below the fold in:
  - index.html (story section and service cards)
  - about.html (CEO portrait)
  - Other images already benefit from lazy loading

### 4. Cache Control Headers
- Added cache control meta tags for better browser caching
- Set max-age to 1 year for static assets

### 5. Created Documentation
- `optimize-performance.js` - Reusable script for optimizing HTML files
- `IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide for image optimization
- This summary document

## Performance Benefits

These optimizations provide:

1. **Faster Initial Paint**: Preloading critical resources reduces time to first render
2. **Reduced Layout Shift**: Font optimization prevents text from jumping
3. **Lower Bandwidth Usage**: Lazy loading delays image downloads until needed
4. **Better Caching**: Cache headers reduce repeat visits load time
5. **Improved Core Web Vitals**: 
   - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) - Faster with preloaded hero image
   - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) - Reduced with font optimization
   - FID (First Input Delay) - Improved with async resource loading

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **Image Compression**: 
   - Compress images over 200KB (workplace-office.jpg, ai-circuit.jpg, hero-medical.jpg)
   - Consider WebP format for better compression

2. **Service Worker**: 
   - Implement for offline functionality and advanced caching

3. **CDN Implementation**: 
   - Use a CDN for static assets to reduce latency

4. **Code Splitting**: 
   - For JavaScript-heavy pages, implement code splitting

5. **Critical CSS**: 
   - Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content

## Maintenance

- Review new images before upload using the IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md
- Run the optimize-performance.js script on new pages
- Monitor Core Web Vitals monthly
